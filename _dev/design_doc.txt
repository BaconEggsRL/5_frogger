Frogger:
Tile-based game
Sprites, music

15x15 rect = 960



Goal:
#Make a tile-based frog that can move within the tile map

#Make and animate a frog. 
#The frog can move up, down, left, or right. 
#Instead of moving smoothly, the frog should hop each time a button is pressed. 
#Each button press will move the frog one tile. 

#Make the play area. 
#The area is divided into lanes (rows). 
#There is a safe lane, five lanes of road, another safe lane, and five lanes of water. 
#Finally, there are five lillypads on the top of the screen.

# Make and animate the game obstacles. 
# All obstacles and platforms will cross the screen horizontally. 
# Obstacles will alternate direction for each lane.

# The road has cars. 
# Each lane has a unique pattern of cars, and speeds vary between lanes.

# The river has alternating lanes of logs and turtles. 




The player should die if:
# they leave the screen (from logs or turtles.)
# they are hit by a car
they fall in the water (frogs can drown, apparently)

if tile is water and not is_on_platform

they are eaten by a wild animal
If the player reaches a lillypad on the top of the screen, the lillypad will be “full.” When all five lillypads are full, the level is complete.
Add a UI with a life counter and a score counter.
Create an animation or use a particle effect to make the frog’s death extra juicy!





Stretch goal:
Some turtles can dive underwater periodically. 
Some logs are actually crocodiles, which can eat the player if the player lands in their open mouth.

(next level after winning.)
Make multiple levels. Higher difficulty levels feature more (faster) cars, and less platforms. Also, more logs crocodiles, and the center safe zone now features a snake (that can eat the player)
